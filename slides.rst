.. note:: Alex Speaks
  Part of being prepared is hardening your systems and environment. But you can't just set it up and walk away, you should have a system of consistently evaluating your state to make sure your following the best practices.

.. note:: Alex Speaks

  Trusted Advisor provides guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.

  Not just security. Also performance and cost.

  around 12 built in checks, but only 3 or 4 for free

  Full checks come with a business or enterprise support plan starting at 100 a month.

  No API

  But it is CEO Friendly.

`AWS Blog: Dynamic Compliance Checking for Cloud Resources <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-config-rules-dynamic-compliance-checking-for-cloud-resources/>`_

.. note:: Alex Speaks

  Config deals with logging what is called a configuration item for supported AWS resources whenever a supported resource is created, deleted, or changed.

  Supported resource are things like ec2 instances, VPCs, iam users. This historical record allows you to answer the question, what policies were attached to a particular user at some time.

  AWS Config rules is a distinct offering from config. Config Rules evaluates the configuration item against a set of predefined critieria

  AWS provides a set of configurable rules users may use, as well as the ability to make custom rules.

  Configuration items are one third of a cent. Config rules are $2/month with 20,000 evals. Further evals are $0.1 per 1,000.

**What we love about it!**

* Rule Based Approach
* Large coverage
* Can run on premise or in another account
* It solves real compliance problems that you have

.. note:: Alex Speaks

    Cloud custodian is a rule engine for evaluation custom policies.

    It covers a lot of the aws surface area: ~60 services and resources, ~160 actions.

    A part of Netflix's SimianArmy suite of infrastructure tools.

    Similar to Config it'll track item states over time and create a security scorecard.

    Biggest Diff: this is statefull, you set up the infra and it runs periodic checks and logs findings

    Example picture shows justifying an event, which you can then revisit later.

    check users for permissive policies.

    But no automation and not detailed enough.

IR in AWS: Containment
======================================

Using aws_ir to:
-----------------

Contain a Host Compromise

and
---

Contain a Key Compromise

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

     Explain AWS_IR. Contains and collects forensic evidence.

----

IR in AWS: Containment
======================================

Containing a Host Compromise
-------------------------------

 - Implement a security group to block all in/out traffic except to whitelist.
 - Coming soon to aws_ir: add a network ACL.

aws_ir usage
---------------


.. code-block:: bash

    aws_ir host_compromise 1.2.3.4

.. note:: Andrew Speaks
   2 Things to contain a host:

   New Security Group

   Change network ACL to sever established connections.

---------

IR in AWS: Containment
======================================

Containing a Key Compromise
-------------------------------

 - Disable the access key.
 - Coming soon to aws_ir: Block STS Tokens.

aws_ir usage
---------------


.. code-block:: bash

    aws_ir key_compromise AYAabyabyabyabyabya

.. note:: Andrew Speaks
   2 Things to contain a key:

   Disable the access key

   Block STS tokens, possiblly revoke all policies for that user until you understand what happened.

---------

Host Compromise leads to
=========================
Key Compromise
==================================

Ever heard of the metadata service?
-------------------------------------

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

   Host compromise leads to Key compromise from the metadata service

-----------------

**MetaData Service**

.. code-block:: bash

    https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2016.03-release-notes/
    13 package(s) needed for security, out of 26 available
    Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

   Just curl a URL and you can get all kinds of information.

-----------------

**Determine Instance Profile**

.. code-block:: bash

    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/info
    {
      "Code" : "Success",
      "LastUpdated" : "2016-09-21T17:00:07Z",
      "InstanceProfileArn" : "arn:aws:iam::671642278147:instance-profile/\

      cloudresponse_workstation-cr-16-080120-e5c0-us-west-1",

      "InstanceProfileId" : "AIPAJJWTONXQ7CLMRENCO"
    }

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

   Curl /iam/info to get the role name from the InstanceProfileARN. Once you get the role name

-----------------

**Once you know the role name**

.. code-block:: bash

    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/\
    security-credentials/cloudresponse_workstation-cr-16-080120-e5c0-us-west-1

      "Expiration" : "2016-09-21T23:05:14Z"
    }

Winning!
================================

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

   Query for the security credentials for that role and you can get access key id and secret.

-----------------

So what?
===============

You can protect against this
--------------------------------

Good old iptables to the rescue.

.. code-block:: bash

    iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner ! —uid-owner root -d 169.254.169.254 -j DROP

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

   Implement IP tables so only the processes owned by root can query the service.

-----------------

Key Compromise leads to
=========================
Host Compromise
==================================

 1. Snapshot Disk for Targeted Host

 2. Mount Snapshot onto attacker-controlled image

 3. ???

 4. Profit!

.. note:: Andrew Speaks

   Read steps.

   This may or may not actually get you on the box, depending on setup. But its possible /etc/shadow might show some weak hashes, or the credentials to the database are stored in plaintext some where.

IR in AWS: Eradication
=======================

 .. raw:: html

     <div id="player-container"></div>
     <script>
       asciinema.player.js.CreatePlayer('player-container',
        'casts/host.json',
       {
         speed : 5,
       }
       );
     </script>

.. note:: Alex Speaks

    For eradication, focus on performing forensics on a compromised host to understand the extent of the breach, ensure we contained it, and determine the problem that needs to be patched.

    In this video you'll see aws_ir run against a compromised host.

    We should note its running at 5x speed.

    It will contain the host, and then it will start extracting all the forensic evidence it can.

    Lets Discuss what evicence to collect.

----

IR in AWS: Eradication
=======================

Evidence Data to Collect
---------------------------

 1. AWS Data
 2. Disk
 3. Memory
 4. Network

And store in a case specific S3 bucket
-----------------------------------------

.. note:: Alex Speaks
  You'll want to collect AWS specific data, disk, memory and Network data.

  At this time aws_ir collects the AWS, Disk and Memory Data.

----


IR in AWS: Eradication
=======================

Evidence Data to Collect: AWS Data
-----------------------------------------

 1. EC2 Console Output
 2. EC2 Console Screenshot
 3. AWS Meta-Data

  - Attached Device Volume IDs
  - Network Devices and Local / Public IPs
  - AMI-ID

 4. Relevant CloudTrail Logs

  - Coming soon to aws_ir

.. note:: Alex Speaks

----

Analyze Evidence: EC2 Disks
=====================================

Snapshot attached disks.

Analyze with ThreatResponse Workstation.

.. image:: static/analyze-disk.png
    :align: center
    :width: 640px

.. note:: Alex Speaks

  Another tool we released is the threatresponse workstation.

  The workstation is an AMI that can be launched with aws-ir, and it adds lots of features around disk and memory analysis.

----

Analyze Evidence: EC2 Disks
=====================================


.. image:: static/disk-processing2.svg
    :align: center
    :width: 640px

.. note:: Alex Speaks
    Within threatresponse workstation we can spin up an AWS ec2 image and process the disk into a .plaso file using log2timeline.

    Anyone who has used log2timeline knows that it can be a bit tricky to get going, so having it available at the click of a button is really nice.

    When log2timeline complets our plaso file will be placed within our s3 case bucket.

----

Analyze Evidence: EC2 Disks
=====================================

`TimeSketch <https://github.com/google/timesketch>`_

.. image:: static/timesketch.png
    :align: center
    :width: 640px

.. note:: Alex Speaks
    We can view our .plaso file using the TimeSketch tool. TimeSketch is a tool made by Google, but they dont consider it a google project, per se. It is a handy tool to analyze timeline events and mark or collaborate on signifigant findings.

 Standalone Memory Acquisition Tool

 - SSH to target using Paramiko
 - Determines Kernel
 - Copies over Kernel Module

  - **We have most most kernel modules pre-compiled for Amazon Certified AMIs**

 - Copies memory to an S3 bucket using a secure network connection

.. note:: Alex Speaks
    MS is a standalone Memory Acquisition tool designed by Joel Ferrier on the ThreatResponse Team.

    SSH to target using Paramiko

    Determines Kernel

    Copies over Kernel Module

    We have most most kernel modules pre-compiled for Amazon Certified AMIs. You can also specifiy your own source of KM if you don't trust us.

    Copies memory to an S3 bucket using a secure network connection.

----

Analyze Evidence: Memory
=====================================

.. image:: static/analyze-view-memory2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 640px

.. note:: Alex Speaks
    Once the memory lime file is in s3 bucket, you launch volatility from within the ThreatResponse Workstation to analyse the memory.

----

Analyze Evidence: Memory
=====================================

.. image:: static/analyze-view-terminal2.png

That concludes IR within AWS. Lets take a look at Advanced attacks and Defenses in AWS.

-------------------------

The AWS Security ECO System
=============================

Basically all you need is:

1. Word about a Cloud
2. Action or a Place
3. ( Optional a thing to operate on )

You too can make Product Madlibs

.. note:: Andrew Speaks


--------------------------------

Attack Time!
==============================

Trivia Question
----------------

Who Said: "Defense without Offense is after all just Compliance."

---------------------------

A: "Dan Kaminsky in Read My Lips: Let’s Kill 0Day"

AWS Advanced Attacks
================================

* Logging Disruption
* STS Persistence
* *New* Super Cool API Gateway Persistence

------------------------------

PSA : GroundRules
=============================

.. image:: static/boring.jpg
    :align: center

Non-Boring Material Ahead!
----------------------------

------------------------------

Logging Disruption
===============================================

Three Variations of This
---------------------------

1. Just Stop Trail - Boring
2. Stop Regional Logging or Global Logging - Less Boring
3. Make CloudTrail operate but logs are unreadable - Best!!

------------------------------

The Cool Attack
======================================

This is your CloudTrail
------------------------------------

.. image:: static/normalcloudtrail.png
    :align: center


------------------------------

**This is your CloudTrail on Crypto**

----------------------------------

When the attack happens...
==============================================

.. image:: static/moneyfire.jpg
    :align: center

The “bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check” flag allows you the make the key’s
policy immutable after creation, making logging just an exercise in lighting
money on fire with disk consumption. You can’t say Amazon didn’t warn you!

----------------------------------

.. image:: static/sowhat.png

1. Requires a high level of privilege
2. Handy for remaining undetected
3. Not necessarily undetectable...

----------------------------------

Not Normal Activities Here
==============================

.. image:: static/moon.gif
    :align: center

1. Creating KMS Keys with this weird policy
2. Calling update trail on your cloudtrail

----------------------------------

http://bit.ly/2cnpTsK
=================================

There's an article about this type of detection.

CloudWatch Event Pipelines
=========================================

    </video>

----------------------------------

STS Attacks
======================================

.. image:: static/sts.png
    :align: center

----------------------------------

How do they happen?
=====================================

1. Metadata Compromise
2. As a result of key compromise
3. Leaked through an application running in a role

----------------------------------

How do you generate them?
=======================================

.. code-block:: bash

    kali:$ aws sts get-session-token --duration-seconds 129600

---------------------------------

What you get back
==========================

.. code-block:: bash

    {
        "Credentials": {
            "SecretAccessKey": "S/aDDL86juKF3*****************************",
            "SessionToken": "FQoDYXdzEG***********************************",
            "Expiration": "2016-09-23T05:26:51Z",
            "AccessKeyId": "ASIAJ5*****************************"
        }
    }

---------------------------------

So what?
==================================

1. You can't revoke temporary STS tokens
2. Without CloudTrail you have no way to know how many exist
3. Someone can use these to end you


--------------------------------

Companies have ceased to be.
==================================

--------------------------------

Trust is hard to gain!
============================================

Easy to lose.
---------------------------------

--------------------------------


How do you
=================================

defend against STS?
=====================

--------------------------------


You don't.
=============

--------------------------------

J/K
=======================

.. image:: static/disable-sts.png
    :align: center

-------------------------------

Three Supported Techniques
=================================

1. Denying Access to the Creator
2. Denying Access to by Name

3. **Denying Access to Credentials
Issued Before xx/xx/xx 00:00:00**

-------------------------------

Time Based Revocation
====================================

.. code-block:: bash

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": "*",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {"DateLessThan": {"aws:TokenIssueTime": "2014-05-07T23:47:00Z"}}
      }
    }

1 and done policy attach to all roles
---------------------------------------

--------------------------------

Go defend!
==================

Backdoors via API Gateway!
==========================================

.. image:: static/apigw.jpg

--------------------------------

Serverless is the Future
============================

I agree!
-------------------

--------------------------------

Serverless is the future!
====================================

Of attacks!
=======================

--------------------------------

What could you do with serverless attacks?
============================================

1. Backdoors
2. Exfiltrate data via http
3. Run a CNC for BotNet
4. Run a ransomware backend....


Endless Possibility
----------------------

--------------------------------

Why make a backdoor tool?
==============================

Trivia Question
----------------

Who Said: "It was once my job to think as Dark Wizards do?"

-----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    Professor Moody: The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object.
    Only an exceptionally powerful Confundus charm could have hoodwinked it!
    Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.
    Igor Karkaroff: You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye!

A: "Mad Eye Moody"

------------------------------

Just Imagine
============================

.. image:: static/story1.jpg

You're working in the magical land of Cosnovion.


------------------------------

Then bad things happen
============================

.. image:: static/story2.jpg

One of your developers leaks a super privileged access key...

------------------------------

You save the day?
============================

.. image:: static/story3.jpg

They said give us some money or else.  Boss asks you to clean the account.
And you do! You even revoked STS Tokens!


-------------------------------

Attackers end your company
============================

.. image:: static/story4.jpg

Attackers end your company through a super cool new type of persistence.

The End


--------------------------------

So what?
=================================

Let's look at the MadKing
--------------------------

------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <div id="player-container23"></div>
    <script>
      asciinema.player.js.CreatePlayer('player-container23', 'casts/mad-king.json',
      {
        speed : 5,
      }
      );
    </script>

    </video>


-------------------------------

Did we just burn them all?
===================================

-------------------------------

So what?
==================

1. Small payload
2. Gives you persistence
3. Cleans up it's own logs when it goes away
4. Most platforms probably aren't auditing serverless
5. No security groups for APIGateway endpoints
